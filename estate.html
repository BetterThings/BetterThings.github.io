                    <h2>Estate Planning </h2>

                    <p>
                        Estate planning is the process of anticipating and arranging for the disposal of an estate during a person's life. 
                        Estate planning typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize 
                        the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. However, the ultimate goal of estate plan is 
                        determined by the specific goals of the client and may be as simple or complex as the client's needs dictate. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your estate is comprised of everything you own— your car, home, other real estate, checking and savings accounts, 
                        investments, life insurance, furniture, personal possessions. No matter how large or how modest, everyone has an 
                        estate and something in common — you can’t take it with you when you die.
                    </p>

                    <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="#" role="button">View details &raquo;</a></p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h2>Estate Planning is for Everyone</h2>

                    <ul>
                 It is not just for “retired” people, although people do tend to think about it more as they get older. 
                 Unfortunately, we can’t successfully predict how long we will live, and illness and accidents happen to 
                 people of all ages.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Estate planning is not just for “the wealthy,” either, although people who have built some wealth do 
                  often think more about how to preserve it. Good estate planning often means more to families with 
                  modest assets, because they can afford to lose the least.
		</p>
		<p>
		Too many people don’t plan. Individuals put off estate planning because they think they don’t own enough, they’re 
		not old enough, they’re busy, think they have plenty of time, they’re confused and don’t know who can help them, 
		or they just don’t want to think it. Then, when something happens to them, their families have to pick up the pieces.
		</p>

                    </ul>

                    

                    <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="#" role="button">View details &raquo;</a></p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h2>If You Don’t have a Plan, Your State has One for You. <p>
                    	(but You Probably Won’t Like it)</h2>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                       At disability: If your name is on the title of your assets and you can’t conduct business due to mental or 
                       physical incapacity, only a court appointee can sign for you. The court, not your family, will control how 
                       your assets are used to care for you through a conservatorship or guardianship. It can become expensive and 
                       time consuming, it is open to the public, and it can be difficult to end even if you recover.
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    	At your death: If you die without an intentional estate plan, your assets will be distributed according to the 
                    	probate laws in your state. In many states, if you are married and have children, your spouse and children will 
                    	each receive a share. That means your spouse could receive only a fraction of your estate, which may not be enough 
                    	to live on. If you have minor children, the court will control their inheritance. If both parents die (i.e., in 
                    	a car accident), the court will appoint a guardian without knowing whom you would have chosen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Given the choice—and you do have the choice—wouldn’t you prefer these matters be handled privately by your family, 
                    	not by the courts? Wouldn’t you prefer to keep control of who receives what and when? And, if you have young 
                    	children, wouldn’t you prefer to have a say in who will raise them if you can’t?
