                    <p>
                        It is the policy of Better Things Financial Partners, LLC to protect the
                        confidentiality and security of information we collect about our
                        customers. Non-public information (“Information”) about you will
                        not be shared with third parties without your consent, except
                        for the specified purposes described below. This notice describes
                        the information we may gather from you and the circumstances under
                        which we may share it. Our clearing firm Shareholder Services Group, Inc.
                        has a separate privacy policy which will explain their privacy practice. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why We Collect and How We Use Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Better Things Financial Partners, LLC limits the collection and use of information
                        to the minimum required to offer and deliver products and services
                        to you. Such services include maintaining your account(s), processing
                        transactions and administering our business. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>How We Gather Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        We get most information directly from you, when you apply for, access
                        and use financial products and services offered by Better Things Financial
                        Partners LLC, whether in person, by telephone or electronically. We may verify
                        this information or get additional information from consumer reporting
                        agencies or public sources. This information may relate to your finances,
                        employment, avocations or other personal characteristics, as well as
                        transactions and interactions with our clearing firms, others or us. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>How We Protect Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our employees are required to protect the confidentiality of information
                        and to comply with established policies. They may access information
                        only when there is an appropriate reason to do so, such as to administer
                        our products and services. We also maintain physical, electronic and
                        procedural safeguards to protect information that comply with applicable
                        laws. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy may be subject to
                        disciplinary action. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may disclose any information to, or as directed by our clearing firms,
                        or when we believe it necessary for the conduct of our business, or where
                        required by law. Information may be disclosed for audit and research
                        purposes, to attorneys or other professionals, or to law enforcement and
                        regulatory agencies, for example, to help us prevent fraud or money laundering.
                        In addition, we may disclose information to third party service providers,
                        (i) to enable them to provide business services for us and our clearing
                        firm, such as performing computer related or data maintenance or processing
                        of services, (ii) to facilitate the processing of transactions requested by
                        you. We will not make any disclosures of information to other companies who
                        may want to sell their products or services to you. 
                    </p>

                        We Do Not Sell Customer Lists<br />

                    <p>
                        It is the policy of Better Things Financial Partners, LLC to require all third parties,
                        other than our clearing firms, that receive information to sign strict
                        confidentiality agreements. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>What are my rights to opt out of disclosure and how can I exercise them</h3>
                    <p>
                        In certain circumstances, the law allows you to "opt out" of our sharing
                        nonpublic personal information about you with affiliated and nonaffiliated
                        companies; that is, you may direct us not to make such disclosures. We do
                        not currently share information about you with any affiliate or third party
                        that triggers this “opt out” right; therefore, there is no need for you to
                        “opt out”. If in the future we desire to disclose your information in a way
                        that is inconsistent with this policy, we will notify you in advance and
                        provide you with the opportunity to “opt out” of such disclosure. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Access To and Correction of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Please contact us, if you desire to review any file we may maintain of
                        your personal information. If you notify us that the information is
                        incorrect, we will review it and amend our records if appropriate. If
                        we do not agree that the information is incorrect, you may submit a short
                        statement of dispute, which we will include in future disclosures of the
                        disputed information. Information collected in connection with, or in
                        anticipation of, any claim or legal proceeding will not be made available.  
                    </p>
