VisualEvent.js (github.com/DataTables/VisualEvent) as used in MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of visualevent.js currently being used by MobileSiteOS. These are not the standard files found at github.com/DataTables/VisualEvent. These are adaptations which depend on MobileSiteOS and will not function without it. We added code to VisualEvent.parser for jQuery v1.9+ before it was made available by DataTables/VisualEvent. Since then, they improved that code and we have reworked to their latest revision (as of 3/11/2014). There are many other small changes for MobileSiteOs usage, but the basic script function is the same. We also renamed visualevent.js by version.
