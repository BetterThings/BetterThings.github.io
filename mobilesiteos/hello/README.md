MobileSiteOS adaptation of the HelloJS client side OAuth2 Javascript SDK

These are the files MobileSiteOS uses for client side OAuth2 authorization, as derived from the HelloJS JavaScript SDK. The original version files can be found at https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js. Our version is MobileSiteOS specific and only does OAuth2 authorization, (no OAuth1 with a oauth proxy). As such, they are of reduced size and are a highly modified version of the originals, with MobileSiteOS debugging and module loading added in too.
