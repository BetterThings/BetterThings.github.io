Hammer.js (github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js) as used in MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of Hammer.js currently being used by MobileSiteOS. These are typically just the standard hammer.js and hammer.min.js files, as found under github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js. We however rename them by version.

Also included are the touch emulation scripts used for "desktop" display. These are the standard Hammer files except they include MobileSiteOS module and version code at the top of each script.
