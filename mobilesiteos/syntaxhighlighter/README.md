=====================

SyntaxHighlighter.js (github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter) as used in MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of syntaxhighlighter.js currently being used by MobileSiteOS. These are typically just the standard syntaxhighlighter.js and syntaxhighlighter.min.js files, as found under github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter. We however rename them by version.

Please note however: the "brushes" files used for each syntax have been converted to use MobileSiteOS module loading and thus are not useable elsewhere. Also, initial syntaxhighlighter.js script and css loading is handled by our module "msos.syntaxhighlighter".
