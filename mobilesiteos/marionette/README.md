==============

Marionette.js (github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) as used in MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of Marionette.js currently being used by MobileSiteOS. These are just the standard marionette.js and marionette.min.js files found under github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette, put with some code removed. We removed the marionette.js module loading code, as we use our own system wide version. Also, we rename them by version.
