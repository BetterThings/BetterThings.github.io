MobileSiteOS implementation of Candy Chat, a JavaScript client side multi-user chat room program.

These are the files MobileSiteOS uses for our client side chat program, as derived from Candy Chat (http://candy-chat.github.io/candy/) a chat room software program. As such, they are a highly modified version of the original program, with extensive MobileSiteOS debugging and broken up into modules for easier maintenance and loading.
