MustacheJS templating program as used by MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of MustacheJS (https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/blob/master/mustache.js) being used by MobileSiteOS. We use the standard MustacheJS script, but rename it by version. MustacheJS is currently only used by the Candy Chat software, as found in the osm_candy repository.
