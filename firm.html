                    retirement plans. It is a serious problem, but there is a solution:

					<p>
						Better Things Financial Partners LLC (“BTFP”) was founded in 2014. Charles Scott Estes
						is the 100% owner. BTFP is a fee based financial planning and investment management firm.
					</p>

					<p>
						Investment advice is provided, with the client making the final decision on investment
						selection. BTFP does not act as a custodian of client assets.
					</p>

					<p>
						An evaluation of each client's initial situation is provided to the client, often in the form
						of a net worth statement, risk analysis or similar document. Periodic reviews are also
						communicated to provide reminders of the specific courses of action that need to be
						taken. More frequent reviews occur but are not necessarily communicated to the client
						unless immediate changes are recommended.
					</p>

					<p>
						Other professionals (e.g., lawyers, accountants, tax preparers, insurance agents, etc.) are
						engaged directly by the client on an as-needed basis and may charge fees of their own.
						Conflicts of interest will be disclosed to the client in the event they should occur.
					</p>

                    <h2>Advisory Services</h2>

					<p>
						BTFP provides investment supervisory services, also known as asset management
						services and furnishes financial planning and investment advice through consultations.
					</p>

					<h3>Asset Management</h3>

					<p>
						BTFP offers non-discretionary direct asset management services to advisory clients.
						BTFP will determine the securities to be bought or sold and the amount of the securities
						to be bought or sold. However, BTFP will obtain prior client approval before executing
						any transactions. BTFP will offer clients ongoing portfolio management services through
						determining individual investment goals, time horizons, objectives, and risk tolerance.
						Investment strategies, investment selection, assets allocation, portfolio monitoring and
						the overall investment program will be based on the above factors.
					</p>

					<h3>Financial Planning and Consulting</h3>

					<p>
						BTFP offers financial planning and consulting services to all clients. Clients will
						compensate BTFP as described in detail under “Fees and Compensation” section of this
						brochure. Services include but are not limited to a thorough review of all applicable
						topics including Wills, Estate Plan/Trusts, Investments, Taxes, and Insurance. If a conflict
						of interest exists between the interests of the investment advisor and the interests of the
						client, the client is under no obligation to act upon the investment advisor’s
						recommendation. If the client elects to act on any of the recommendations, the client is
						under no obligation to effect the transaction through BTFP.

						restrictions on investing in certain securities or types of securities.
						Agreements may not be assigned without written client consent.
